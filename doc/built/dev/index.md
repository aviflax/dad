# Developing and Testing DaD

## Dependencies

* [Clojure](https://clojure.org/) for development
* [GraalVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GraalVM) for building executables
* [JRE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine#Java_Runtime_Environment) for development
* [Selmer](https://github.com/yogthos/Selmer) for templating

## Testing

Coming soon!

## Building

We have a few useful scripts:

* bin/build-uberjar
* bin/build-native-image

The latter will build an executable that can run on the same OS and architecture as the machine on
which it’s run.
