# What is “Docs as Data”?

I’m terribly sorry, but I have not yet had a chance to articulate what this *is* exactly, not
really, not quite yet. You see, I’ve been applying the [Docs as **Code**][dac] philosophy within
[Funding Circle][funding-circle] for a few years, to great effect. But I found that for my
particular efforts, *Docs as Code* didn’t go quite far enough. I realized (slowly) that my efforts
would be best served by reifying the content of my documentation, and my team’s documentation, as
*data*. It took me some time and some exploration to start to figure out what that might mean, and
I’ve made some progress — but not *quite* enough to actually explain what this is. Yet.

Soon!
